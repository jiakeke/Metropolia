2. Variables and interactive programs

    2.5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a mass in medieval units:
         talents (leivisk√§), pounds (naula), and lots (luoti). The program
         converts the input to full kilograms and grams and outputs the result
         to the user:

             - One talent is 20 pounds.
             - One pound is 32 lots.
             - One lot is 13,3 grams.
