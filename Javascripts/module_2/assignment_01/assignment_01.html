        Question 2.1:

            Write a program that prompts the user for five numbers and prints
            them in the reverse order they were entered. Print the result to
            the console.(2p)

                - Save the numbers to an array, then use for-loop to iterate in
                  reverse order.

                - Do not use array.reverse() function.
