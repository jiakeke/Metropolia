    <!-- 
        Question 2.7:

            Modify the function above so that it gets the number of sides on
            the dice as a parameter. With the modified function you can for
            example roll a 21-sided role-playing dice. The difference to the
            last exercise is that the dice rolling in the main program
            continues until the program gets the maximum number on the dice,
            which is asked from the user at the beginning.
