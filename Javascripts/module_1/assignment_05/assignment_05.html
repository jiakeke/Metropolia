    <!-- 
        Question 1.5:

            Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and notifies the
            user whether the input year is a leap year. A year is a leap year
            if it is divisible by four. However, years divisible by 100 are
            leap years only if they are also divisible by 400. Print the result
            on the HTML document.
