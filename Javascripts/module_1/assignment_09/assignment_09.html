        Question 1.9:

            Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the
            number is a prime number.

                - Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by 1 and
                  itself.

                - For example, number 13 is a prime number as it can only be
                  divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.

                - On the other hand, number 21 for example is not a prime
                  number as it can be also be divided by numbers 3 and 7.

                - Print the result on the HTML document.
