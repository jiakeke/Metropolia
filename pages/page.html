                Open source technologies are all set to transform the IT services domain.
                Over the past decade, we have witnessed how more and more enterprises are
                adopting open source technologies to help improve their strategic IT goals.
                Open source technologies are bringing down the overall costs of software
                development. We have also witnessed leading software proprietary companies
                also contributing towards open source development as they understand that
                this is going to be the future of IT. Open source technologies are assisting
                businesses in reducing the IT operating costs and improving performance of
                their IT assets. At Parsupp, we strongly believe that Open source technology
                offers higher performance and reliability and is a cost effective medium for
                software development.

                    People choose to outsource for many different reasons.

                    Some people may not be able to afford the cost of hiring employees,
                    so they may see outsourcing as a more affordable option.

                    On the surface, outsourcing can seem a little daunting and expensive
                    because it will require some training and time spent setting up an
                    account with your outsourced service provider.  However, outsourcing
                    can end up saving you valuable time and money in the long run.

                    An employee can be a huge cost, as they get paid hourly or by the year.
                    You also have to pay them whether they're sick or not. When you outsource,
                    you can set your own hours and determine your own schedule.
